# FlashCardApp â€“ A simple and extendable JavaFX flashcard learning tool

**FlashCardApp** is a clean, beginner-friendly application written in JavaFX that allows users to **learn using flashcards loaded from text files**.

Each flashcard set is currently read from a single file (e.g., `questions.txt`), and the app enables you to navigate through questions and reveal answers one by one.  
The application works fully as a **standalone `.exe` desktop app** â€“ no Java installation required.
